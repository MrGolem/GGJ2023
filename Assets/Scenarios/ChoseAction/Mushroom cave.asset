  Title: Mushroom cave
  MainDescription: When you reach the fork in the maze, you again enter a spacious
    cave, in the middle of the cave you see the remains of knights, among which you
    see good leather armor. On the other side lie the mage's remains and his bag
    of potions. You take a step, step on a mushroom, and all over the floor mushrooms
    burst and begin to release gas.
